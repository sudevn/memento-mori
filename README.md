# Memento mori

> Latin for 'Remember your death', Memento Mori is a powerful concept that's been used for centuries to help people focus on what truly matters.
> The calendar was designed as an interactive tool to help you harness the concept by visualizing your life week by week.


The code is hybrid of [sunday](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/sunday) and [mementoMori](https://github.com/afonsocrg/mementoMori) (huge thanks to JS belongs to [afonsocrg](https://github.com/afonsocrg)) + bunch of my own additions.
